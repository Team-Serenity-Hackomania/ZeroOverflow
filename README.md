# ZeroOverflow
ZeroOverflow is an IoT-based smart waste management system using NodeMCU and ultrasonic sensors to monitor bin fill levels. Data is sent to a Django REST API, which triggers alerts when bins near capacity. A React dashboard visualizes real-time bin data, enabling efficient, data-driven urban waste collection.
